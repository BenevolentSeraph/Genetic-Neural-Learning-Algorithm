Neuron:
Each neuron takes in a number of inputs
An output is given by adding all the inputs multiplied by their respective weight, then adding a bias
Example Code:
inputs = [1,2,3]
weights = [1,0,1]
bias = 1
output = inputs[0]*weights[0]+inputs[1]*weights[1]+inputs[2]*weights[2]+bias
Example Math:
inputs = [1,2,3]
weights = [1,0,1]
bias = 1
output = 1*1+2*0+3*1+1 = 5

Organism (brain):
An organism that can move in 4 directions: up, down, left, and right.
4 neurons that looks at the immediate locations above, below, and next to the organism generates an output and has an assigned action.
Whichever neuron has the highest output gets their action used.
